			<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
			<h2>What data do we sell to other companies?</h2>
			<p>None.</p>
			<h2>What data do we process for use in advertising?</h2>
			<p>None.</p>
			<h2>How do we make money?</h2>
			<p>We don't. In the future if Fishpowered browser becomes popular we 
			will explore monetising the app through fair and transparent schemes, for example selling
			themes, merchandise and Patreon backing. We would like to stress that we will never sell a user's
			browsing/personal data in order for advertising or any other means.</p>
			
			<h2>What data leaves my device from the Fishpowered browser app?</h2>
			<p>Nothing you wouldn't expect from a typical web browser...</p>
			<p>Specifically:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Normal information related to a typical web page visit. This means in practice that
				the cookies you have acculumated and the web page address you have requested are
				sent to the server you are visiting in a standard way. You can control which cookies
				are collected and by default Fishpowered browser will attempt to block
				advertising/tracking cookies and other advertising/tracking requests. This can be changed
				in the settings.</li>
				<li>Anything you actively submit to a web site e.g. uploaded photos, submitted text etc.</li>
				<li>Anything you agree to share e.g. a site may request your GPS location</li>
				<li>Android/Google play store will automatically backup apps, their preferences and their data. This can
				be disabled in Android settings.</li>
				<li>Crash reports (in the event of a crash). These are anonymous and contain software 
				information about the nature of the crash (source code file, line number, and error message). 
				Potentially	these messages could contain some of your browsing information such as the current URL but 
				there is no personal information to link it to a real person. This crash report
				gets sent to the Crashlytics service provided by Google (formerly Fabric.io) and is commonly used in apps</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Who <em>can</em> view my browsing activity?</h2>
			<p>No-one other than who/what is typically involved in a web browser to server request...</p>
			<p>Specifically:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You. History is visible on the app in the history list, recently used search list
				and used to speed up searches.</li>
				<li>The websites you visit. Specifically, the companies that own the servers, the 
				people/companies that develop the website, the people/companies that commissioned
				the website, and any partners they choose to share data with such
				as advertisers. You should be aware that companies often don't realise they
				are sharing user's browsing activity, for example if they include some 3rd party
				resource that requests information from another server, this request can be tracked.
				By default, we try to block requests to advertisers/undesirable 3rd parties as much possible
				(can be disabled in the settings), and security procedures handled by Android's webview
				library (built on Google Chromium) such as Google's safe browsing protection.</li>
				<li>Searches in the address bar are sent anonymously to Google to receive auto-completion suggestions.</li>
				<li>Visits to unencrypted websites can potentially be spied upon by anyone who
				can intercept your data transmission to/from the server. An unlocked
				padlock is displayed when visiting an insecure website.</li>
				<li>Anyone with physical/virtual access to your device (passwords/locks permitting).</li>
				<li>Any other apps or users with admin/root permissions to your device.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>What data is stored on my device as a result of using the Fishpowered browser?</h2>
			<p>Nothing you wouldn't expect from a typical web browser...</p>
			<p>Specifically:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Browsing history. Specifically, web searches, visited web pages (address, 
				start time, end time), data the website has requested to be stored (e.g. cookies, 
				offline databases etc), cached resources to speed 
				up page load time (e.g. images, CSS, javascript, fonts etc). This data can easily be 
				cleared in the app.</li>
				<li>Saved usernames. We don't store passwords but for convenience we store usernames that
				have been entered whilst logging into a website with incognito mode disabled.</li>
				<li>App preferences/settings. For example, selected theme, privacy settings, content settings etc</li>
				<li>Site preferences/settings. For example, should the site have access to your device's 
				GPS data (defaults to false), attempt to block ads etc.</li>
				<li>Any favourites (bookmarks) you make. These can easily be cleared.</li>
				<li>Any files you download from the internet.</li>
				<li>Temporary files created by the app for caching purposes e.g. caching of tab preview thumbnails, favourite images etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>What data/permissions does Fishpowered browser have access to on my phone?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The phone's state/status. This is used to detect incoming phone calls/messages and pause playback of the postcast/listen mode. Unfortunately this permission also grants the app access to the phone's telephone number. This data is not collected/used. We are currently looking at ways to improve this permission so it's not required to download the app, only when the feature is used.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Otherwise nothing you wouldn't expect from a typical web browser, specifically...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The phone's internet connection (mobile data/WIFI) is required to access the internet.</li>
				<li>The devices general location (i.e. to the nearest town) determined by network operator 
				(used when a website requests this information and is permitted it by the user).</li>
				<li>The device's specific GPS/location data (used when a website requests this information and is permitted it by the user).</li>
				<li>The device's network state e.g. is there a valid internet connection.</li>
				<li>The ability to write to external storage e.g. file downloads.</li>
				<li>The ability to record audio for voice searches (sent to Google) and websites that have audio inputs. Note: this requires the users permissions on modern versions of Android and we do not
				store any microphone data.</li>
				<li>Very general and anonymous device data such as screen rotation, dimensions, Android version etc.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
			<h2>What data do we sell to other companies?</h2>
			<p>None.</p>
			<h2>What data do we process for use in advertising?</h2>
			<p>None.</p>
			<h2>How do we make money?</h2>
			<p>We don't. In the future if Fishpowered browser becomes popular we 
			will explore monetising the app through fair and transparent schemes, for example, selling
			themes, merchandise and/or a sponsored default search engine. We would like to stress that we will never sell a user's
			browsing/personal data in order for advertising or any other means.</p>
			
			<h2>What data leaves my device from the Fishpowered browser app?</h2>
			<p>Nothing you wouldn't expect from a typical web browser...</p>
			<p>Specifically:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Normal information related to a typical web page visit. This means in practice that
				the cookies you have acculumated and the web page address you have requested are
				sent to the server you are visiting in a standard way. You can control which cookies
				are collected and by default Fishpowered browser will attempt to block
				advertising/tracking cookies and other advertising/tracking requests. This can be changed
				in the settings.</li>
				<li>Anything you actively submit to a web site e.g. uploaded photos, submitted text etc.</li>
				<li>Anything you agree to share e.g. a site may request your GPS location</li>
				<li>Android/Google play store will automatically backup apps, their preferences and their data. This can
				be disabled in Android settings.</li>
				<li>If when logging into a website, the user opts to allow Google Auto-fill to save the username and password, these will be sync'd to Google's servers.</li> 
				<li>Crash reports (in the event of a crash). These are anonymous, held by Google, and is commonly used by most
                apps to maintain quality. The crash reports contain basic device information (manufacturer, model, Android version) 
				and information about the nature of the crash (source code file, line number, and error message). <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy#crash-stored-info">More information here</a>. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Who <em>can</em> view my browsing activity?</h2>
			<p>No-one other than who/what is typically involved in a web browser to server request...</p>
			<p>Specifically:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You. History is visible on the app in the history list, recently used search list
				and used to speed up searches.</li>
				<li>The websites you visit. Specifically, the companies that own the servers, the 
				people/companies that develop the website, the people/companies that commissioned
				the website, and any partners they choose to share data with such
				as advertisers. You should be aware that companies often don't realise they
				are sharing user's browsing activity, for example if they include some 3rd party
				resource that requests information from another server, this request can be tracked.
				By default, we try to block requests to advertisers/undesirable 3rd parties as much possible
				(can be disabled in the settings), and security procedures handled by Android's webview
				library (built on Google Chromium) such as Google's safe browsing protection.</li>
				<li>Searches in the address bar are sent anonymously to Google to receive auto-completion suggestions.</li>
				<li>Unencrypted websites (e.g. http://) can potentially be spied upon by anyone who
				can intercept your data transmission to/from the server. A red unlocked
				padlock is displayed next to the address when visiting an insecure website.</li>
				<li>Anyone with physical/virtual access to your device (passwords/locks permitting).</li>
				<li>Any other apps or users with <strong>admin/root</strong> permissions to your device.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>What data is stored on my device as a result of using the Fishpowered browser?</h2>
			<p>Nothing you wouldn't expect from a typical web browser...</p>
			<p>Specifically:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Browsing history. Specifically, web searches, visited web pages (address, 
				start time, end time), data the website has requested to be stored (e.g. cookies, 
				offline databases etc), cached resources to speed 
				up page load time (e.g. images, CSS, javascript, fonts etc). This data can easily be 
				cleared in the app.</li>
				<li>App preferences/settings. For example, selected theme, privacy settings, content settings etc</li>
				<li>Site preferences/settings. For example, should the site have access to your device's 
				GPS data (defaults to false), attempt to block ads etc.</li>
				<li>Any favourites (bookmarks) you make. These can easily be cleared.</li>
				<li>Any files you download from the internet.</li>
				<li>Temporary files created by the app for caching purposes e.g. caching of tab preview thumbnails, favourite images etc.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>What data/permissions does Fishpowered browser have access to on my phone?</h2>
			<p>Nothing you wouldn't expect from a typical web browser, specifically...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The phone's internet connection (mobile data/WIFI) is required to access the internet.</li>
				<li>The devices general location (i.e. to the nearest town) determined by network operator 
				(used when a website requests this information and is permitted it by the user).</li>
				<li>The device's specific GPS/location data (used when a website requests this information and is permitted it by the user).</li>
				<li>The device's network state e.g. is there a valid internet connection.</li>
				<li>The ability to write to external storage e.g. file downloads (permission must be granted by the user when they first attempt to write a file).</li>
				<li>The ability to record audio for voice searches (sent to Google) and websites that have audio inputs. Note: this requires the users permissions on modern versions of Android and we do not
				store any microphone data.</li>
				<li>Very general and anonymous device data such as screen rotation, dimensions, Android version etc.</li>
                <li>The ability to create shortcuts on the phone home screen/menus. Used when "pinning" bookmarks/faves.</li>
			</ul>

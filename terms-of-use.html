			<ol>
			  <li>LICENSE GRANT.  Fishpowered browser (Matthew Pike) grants you a non-exclusive license to use the executable code

			  <li>TERMINATION.  If you breach this Agreement your right to use the Product will terminate immediately and without notice, 
			  but all provisions of this Agreement except the License Grant (Paragraph 1) will survive termination and continue in effect.

			  AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH SUCH CLAIM IS BASED.  
			  FISHPOWERED BROWSER (Matthew Pike)'s COLLECTIVE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF 
			  $0 (ZERO DOLLARS) AND THE FEES PAID BY YOU UNDER THE LICENSE (IF ANY).

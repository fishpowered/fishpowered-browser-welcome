				<h2 style="font-size:150%"><a href="https://play.app.goo.gl/?link=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fishpowered.best.browser&ddl=1" style="color:yellow">Download now</a></h2>
				<p>Fishpowered is a browser for people who love the web but are tired with all the ads and privacy hassle they 
				see on modern websites, 
				for people who love to multi-task, and for people who love to customise their software
				to make it their own!</p>
				<p>Featuring ad blocker, cookie warning blocker, 
	tracking/tracker blocker, privacy precautions, pinnable windows, gestures, themes, and more coming soon.</p>
				<h2>The best browser for saving bookmarks, favourites and content?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Tap the fave button on any web page, video, or quote and it'll automatically be saved and categorised</li>
					<li>All your favourites in one place instead of being spread across different apps and logins</li>
					<li>Optionally tag your favourites to further categorise them</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Too busy to read an article or watch a video now?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Use the dedicated "save for later" feature to keep track of articles and videos you don't have time to read now</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>The best browser for customisation?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Browser themes</li>
					<li>Customisable browser buttons</li>
					<li>Customisable gestures</li>
					<li>Customisable home page</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>The best browser for privacy?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Fishpowered blocks ads, cookies from external websites and tracking requests by default</li>
					<li>Enabling Incognito mode allows for 3 levels of further privacy protection from basic to extreme</li>
					<li>Duckduckgo available as a search engine</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Remember when you could use a phone with one hand?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Fishpowered browser lets you customise your UI so your most used actions are always in reach.</li>
					<li>Gestures allow you to perform common actions such as changing and closing tabs quickly and easily.</li>
					<li>No more hand gymnastics as the most common UI elements are placed in the bottom and middle of the screen.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>A useful night mode</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Instead of just dimming everything we just blacken the backgrounds and lighten the text. It's up to you 
					how much you want to dim the screen.</li>
					<li>Doubles as a battery saver mode	as your screen will be displaying websites as if they all had dark themes.</li>
					<li>Even works well in daytime if you prefer to read light text on a dark background.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Fast and secure</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>Built using Google Chrome's chromium engine with <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com">Google's "Safe browsing" protection built-in</a></li>
				</ul>
